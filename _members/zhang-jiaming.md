**Research Field**

Dr. Zhang focuses on musculoskeletal degenerative diseases (including osteoarthritis and intervertebral disc degeneration) and their association with aging-related changes in the systemic environment. He has revealed the role of the bone–cartilage interface and subchondral bone remodeling in joint degeneration, and explored nanomaterial-based and photothermal synergistic strategies for treating degenerative diseases. His research interests also include the interplay between the motor system and internal organs, and the impact of immune microenvironments on musculoskeletal diseases.
